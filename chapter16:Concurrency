Thread

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}

OUTPUT:
hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!

JoinHandle
-wait for its thread to finish

eg.
handle.join().unwrap();

calling join on the handle blocks the thread currently running until the thread represented by the handle terminates.
blocking a thread means that thread if prevented from performing work or exiting.

move
-move is added before the closure force the closure to take ownership of its value

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}

Thread sending each other message

eg.
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

thread::spawn(move || {
    let val = String::from("hi");
    tx.send(val).unwrap();
});

let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
println!("Got: {}", received);

Multiple producer ,single consumer

Shared state concurrency

Mutex
-mutual exclusion

eg.
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);

    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }

    println!("m = {:?}", m);
}

Atomic

The a stands for atomic, meaning it’s an atomically reference counted type
ELI5 :  At this point, you just need to know that atomics work like primitive types but are safe to share across threads.

fn main() {

    //use ARC type
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        
        //clone the counter
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);

        //use move to take control of te ownership
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
