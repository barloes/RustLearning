Chapter 4:Ownership

If a type implements the Copy trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. 

Example of types with copy trait:
All the integer types, such as u32.
The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
All the floating point types, such as f64.
The character type, char.
Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.

Referencing and Borrowing

eg.

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
This will lead to error as we are not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.

Fix with mutable reference 
eg.

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}

1.But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope
2.We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one.

LIFETIME: CAN ONLY RETURN THE OBJECT RATHER THEN THE REFERENCE
s is created inside dangle, when the code of dangle is finished, s will be deallocated.
eg.
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!

String slice:
A string slice is a reference to part of a String, and it looks like this:

let s = String::from("hello world");

let world = &s[6..11];
slice that contains a pointer to the 7th byte (counting from 1) of s with a length value of 5.
