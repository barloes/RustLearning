Chapter 4:Ownership

If a type implements the Copy trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. 

Example of types with copy trait:
All the integer types, such as u32.
The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
All the floating point types, such as f64.
The character type, char.
Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.

Referencing and Borrowing

eg.

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
This will lead to error as we are not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.
