Chapter 8:Collection

Vector
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

vector is freed when it goes out of scope

Iterate the value in the vector and change the value 
eg.
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &mut v {
        *i += 50;
    }

The + operator uses the add method, whose signature looks something like this:
s1 and s2 and both string

let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used

fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {

looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this statement actually takes ownership of s1,
appends a copy of the contents of s2, and then returns ownership of the result

Rust strings don’t support indexing
stored as UTF-8

Hash Map

fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
}
