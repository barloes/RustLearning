Generic type
The type <T> is determined in runtime
eg.
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

x and y must be of the same type

struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

x and y of different type

Trait Keyword
often called interfaces in other languages

eg.
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

The compiler will enforce that any type that has the Summary trait will have the method summarize defined with this signature exactly.

Lifetime

Lifetime Annotation Syntax

&i32        // a reference
&'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime

THIS EXAMPLE WONT WORK
{
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {}", r);
}

THIS EXAMPLE WILL WORK
fn main() {
    {
        let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                              //           |
        let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                              //   |       |
        println!("r: {}", r); //   |       |
                              // --+       |
    }                         // ----------+
}

Explaination:
lifetime of 'b > lifetime of 'a

eg.

fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

Explaination:
The longest function definition specifying that all the references in the signature must have the same lifetime 'a

Lifetime rules:
1.Each parameter that is a reference in the function gets its own lifetime parameter.

eg.
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {

2.If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters

eg.
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {

3. if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.

eg.
fn announce_and_return_part(&self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
        println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
        self.part
    }

Static lifetime 
-reference can live for the entire duration of the program

eg.
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
