Chapter 6: Option<t> and match

enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent
eg.
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

you have to convert an Option<T> to a T before you can perform T operations with it. 
Generally, this helps catch one of the most common issues with null
eg.
    let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

this will not compile as Rust doesn’t understand how to add an i8 and an Option<i8>, because they’re different types.

fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            None => None,
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }


Match

eg.
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}

match that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches.
Similar to switch or if statements in c++
return the coin value based on the type. if coin is penny return 1;

if Let
eg.
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
        println!("three");
    }
