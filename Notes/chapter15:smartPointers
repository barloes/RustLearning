Chapter 15:Smart Pointers

Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. 
eg.

let b = Box::new(5);

Dereference Pointers

eg.
let x = 5;
let y = &x;

assert_eq!(5, x);
assert_eq!(5, *y);

Dereferencing

fn main() {
    hello(&m);
}

Listing 15-12: Calling hello with a reference to a MyBox<String> value, which works because of deref coercion
Here we’re calling the hello function with the argument &m,
which is a reference to a MyBox<String> value. Because we implemented the Deref trait on MyBox<T> in Listing 15-10,
Rust can turn &MyBox<String> into &String by calling deref.

Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:

From &T to &U when T: Deref<Target=U>
From &mut T to &mut U when T: DerefMut<Target=U>
From &mut T to &U when T: Deref<Target=U>
